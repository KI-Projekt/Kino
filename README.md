# Cinema Ticket Reservation System - Front End
 
 ## Branch Rules:
 The main development will be done on the dev branch. Version Releases will be merged on main after approval with all team members.
 All merges on dev need to be merged within an approved Pull-Request. This means that atleast one Front End team member needs to approve the coding of the   feature branch.
 
 ### Naming of the Branches
 
 All feature branches need to be named as follows:
 feat/[TICKET_ID]/[TICKET_NAME] -> the Pull Request follows a similiar naming convention <br>
 e.g. feat: [TICKET_ID] - [TICKET_NAME]
 
 All bug branches need to be named as follows:
 fix/[TICKET_ID]/[TICKET_NAME] -> the Pull Request follows a similiar naming convention <br>
 e.g. fix: [TICKET_ID] - [TICKET_NAME]

##Coding Guidelines
- Simple standalone components will be developped as React Function Components because of simplicity and performance reasons
- Complex Components and Views will be developped as ES6 Classes because of hooks and lifecycle reasons
